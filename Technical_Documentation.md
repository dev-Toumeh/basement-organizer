# Decisions
- project's main focus is learning `Go` in backend and frontend in general (starting with `HTMX` as a lightweight library)
- solve a real world problem
- other goals are simplicity, fast and simple development, desktop and mobile support
    - only browser based, no native apps
    - focus on necessary core functionalities
    - avoiding features that are nice to have
    - less frameworks/dependencies
- have more time for relevant problems and learning
    - use Github as main platform (central place for information)
        - version control
        - documentation
        - issues 
        - no infrastructure needed
        - less searching
        - ability to use CI/CD (Github Actions) at a later time if necessary
